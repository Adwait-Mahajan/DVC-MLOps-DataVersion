1. create a git repo and clone it in local.

2. Create my_code.py and add code to it. (It will save a csv file to a new "data folder")

3. Do a git add-comit-push before initializing DVC.

4. #pip3 install DVC

5. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)

6. Now we do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 Directory)

7. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3" #we put S3 url when we use AWS S3 bucket

8. Next "dvc add data/" #Now you will track the data. 
    • We have to run these two commands -> git rm -r --cached 'data' & git commit -m "stop tracking data"
    • Because initialy we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for dvc to handle.

9. Again we do the dvc add data/ (creates data.dvc) then "git add data.dvc .gitignore

10. The id which we need to track the data is in data.dvc

11. Now
